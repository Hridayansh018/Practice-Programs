11. - Write a program that accepts the lengths of three sides of a triangle 
as inputs. The program output should indicate whether or not the triangle 
is a right triangle (Recall from the Pythagorean Theorem that in a right 
triangle, the square of one side equals the sum of the squares of the 
other two sides).
